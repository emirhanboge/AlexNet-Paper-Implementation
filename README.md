# ML-PaperImplementations

Welcome to the ML-PaperImplementations repository! This is a collection of machine learning paper implementations, intended as a resource for researchers, students, and enthusiasts in the field.

## Description

This repository contains my implementations of various computer vision papers. Each implementation aims to replicate the results of the papers as closely as possible and is provided with a detailed explanation of the approach taken.

## Usage

Each paper implementation is contained in its own directory within the repository. To run a particular implementation, navigate to the corresponding directory and follow the instructions provided in the README.md file for that implementation.


## Installation

To set up a development environment to run the code, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/emirhanboge/CV-Paper-Implementations.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd CV-Paper-Implementations
```

3. Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

5. Upgrade pip:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```

6. Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
