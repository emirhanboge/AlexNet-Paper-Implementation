# CV-Paper-Implementations

Welcome to the CV-Paper-Implementations repository! This is a collection of computer vision paper implementations, intended as a resource for researchers, students, and enthusiasts in the field.

## Description

This repository contains my implementations of various computer vision papers. Each implementation aims to replicate the results of the papers as closely as possible and is provided with a detailed explanation of the approach taken.

## Installation

To set up a development environment to run the code, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/emirhanboge/CV-Paper-Implementations.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd CV-Paper-Implementations
```

3. Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Each paper implementation is contained in its own directory within the repository. To run a particular implementation, navigate to the corresponding directory and follow the instructions provided in the README.md file for that implementation.
